# Phase-3-Project
# Analyzing Terry Stops and Arrest Decisions



## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook focused on analyzing police stop data, specifically addressing the classification problem related to Terry Stops and arrest decisions. My project aims to uncover patterns of racial profiling, assess the effectiveness of police interventions, and provide insights for equitable policing practices.

## Project Goals
- **Identify Patterns**: Analyze the relationship between race (of both officers and subjects) and arrest outcomes during Terry Stops.
- **Measure Disparities**: Investigate disparities in stop rates among different racial and ethnic groups.
- **Evaluate Effectiveness**: Explore common reasons for stops and their correlation with outcomes, such as arrests or citations.
- **Enhance Community Trust**: Provide recommendations for resource allocation that minimize bias and maximize community safety.

## Key Questions

- Does race play a role in the likelihood of an arrest being made?
- Are there disparities in stop rates among various racial or ethnic groups?
- What are the common reasons for stops, and how do they relate to outcomes?
- How effective are the stops in achieving desired resolutions?

## Challenges Addressed

- **Resource Inefficiency**: Understanding stop data to improve resource allocation.
- **Potential Bias**: Identifying and mitigating disproportionate impacts on specific demographic groups.
- **Data Limitations**: Addressing issues related to incomplete or noisy data.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Ensuring transparency and fairness in model predictions.

## Proposed Solution
To run the notebook, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn)

The notebook implements a data-driven approach involving:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Assessing demographic arrest rates and identifying patterns in stop outcomes.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Developing a classification model with a baseline of logistic regression and decision trees to predict arrest likelihood while incorporating ethical safeguards.
3. **Optimization and Validation**: Recommending resource prioritization and evaluating model performance with fairness metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is derived from the Terry v. Ohio case and includes various features related to police stops and arrest outcomes. You can access the dataset [here].

## Non-technical Presentation
Additionally, I've prepared a non-technical presentation which can be found [here].

## Full Results & Dataset
